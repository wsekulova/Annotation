# Annotation

`Books` are grouped into `authors`. All authors are grouped into 25 AH periods, based on the year of their death. These repositories are the main working lociâ€”if any modifications are to be added or made to texts or metadata, all has to be done in files in these folders.

There are three types of text repositories:

- `RAWrabicaXXXXXX` repositories include *raw* texts as they were collected from various open-access online repositories and libraries. These texts are in their initial (*raw*) format and require reformatting and further integration into OpenITI. The overall current number of text files is over 40,000; slightly over 7,000 have been integrated into OpenITI.
- `XXXXAH` are the main working folders that include integrated texts (all coming from collections included into `RAWrabicaXXXXXX` repositories).
- `i.xxxxx` repositories are *instantiations* of the OpenITI corpus adapted for specific forms of analysis. At the moment, these include the following instantiations  (_in progress_):
	- `i.cex` with all texts split mechanically into 300 word units, converted into `cex` format.
	- `i.mech` with all texts split mechanically into 300 word units.
	- `i.logic` with all texts split into logical units (chapters, sections, etc.); only tagged texts are included here (~130 texts at the moment).
	-  `i.passim_new_mech` with all texts split mechanically into 300 word units, converted for the use with new `passim` (JSON).
	- [*not created yet*] `i.passim_new_mech_cluster` with all text split mechanically into 900 word units (3 milestones) with 300 word overlap; converted for the use with new `passim` (JSON).
	- `i.passim_old_mech` with all texts split mechanically into 300 word units, converted for the use with old `passim` (XML, gzipped).
	- `i.stylo` includes all texts from OpenITI (duplicates excluded) that are renamed and slightly reformatted (Arabic orthography is simplified) for the use with `stylo` R-package.
